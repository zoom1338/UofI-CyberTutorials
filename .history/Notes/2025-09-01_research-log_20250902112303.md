Investigating WPA2 Handshake Analysis with Wireshark for Wireless Penetration Testing.

## TL;DR
Wireshark is a packet analysis tool used to view and verify the captured WPA2 4-way handshake. While tools like the Aircrack-ng suite are used to actively capture the handshake from a live network, Wireshark allows for offline analysis to confirm a complete and valid handshake was captured before attempting to crack the password.

## Key Takeaways
- WPA2 penetration testing follows a standard process: reconnaissance (`airodump-ng`), capturing the authentication handshake (often by deauthenticating a client with `aireplay-ng`), and offline password cracking (`aircrack-ng`, `hashcat`).
- Wireshark's role is critical for inspecting the captured traffic (`.cap` file) to ensure all four parts of the WPA2 handshake are present. Without a complete handshake, cracking is impossible.
- WPA3 is significantly more secure against these attacks because its SAE (Dragonfly) handshake resists offline dictionary attacks.

## New Terms
- **WPA2 (Wi-Fi Protected Access 2):** A common Wi-Fi security protocol that uses a 4-way handshake for authentication.
- **4-Way Handshake:** The process in WPA2 where a client and access point exchange four messages to generate and confirm an encryption key.
- **SAE (Simultaneous Authentication of Equals):** The more secure handshake mechanism used in WPA3, designed to prevent offline dictionary attacks.
- **Aircrack-ng Suite:** A collection of tools for Wi-Fi network security auditing and penetration testing.
- **Wireshark:** A network protocol analyzer used for inspecting network traffic.

## Open Questions
1.  How do I conduct a full wireless penetration test on a WPA2/3 network?
2.  What are the best techniques to map wireless networks and their connected clients?
3.  How can I discover and map databases operating on a wireless network?
