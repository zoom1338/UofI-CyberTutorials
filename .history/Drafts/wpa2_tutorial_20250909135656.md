# WPA2-PSK Handshake Capture & Cracking Tutorial

## 1. Overview

Wi-Fi Protected Access II (WPA2) has been the dominant security protocol for wireless networks for over a decade, protecting digital communications in homes, businesses, and public spaces worldwide. It relies on a Pre-Shared Key (PSK) and a process called the 4-Way Handshake to establish a secure connection between a device and a router. While robust for its time, a critical vulnerability exists within this handshake process. An attacker within physical proximity can passively capture the handshake data without alerting the network. This captured data can then be taken offline and subjected to a brute-force or dictionary attack to recover the network's password.

This tutorial provides a hands-on exploration of this well-known vulnerability, guiding you through the process of analyzing and cracking a captured WPA2 handshake. For cybersecurity students and aspiring professionals, understanding this process is fundamental. It offers a practical lesson in cryptography, network protocols, and ethical hacking methodologies. By dissecting a real-world attack vector, you will gain a deeper appreciation for the mechanics of wireless security, the limitations of legacy protocols, and the critical advancements introduced in its successor, WPA3. This exercise is not merely about breaking a password; it is about understanding the underlying principles that govern secure network communications and learning the attacker's mindset to better build defensive strategies.

## 2. Lab Setup

This tutorial assumes you are using a Kali Linux virtual machine, which comes pre-installed with the necessary tools.

- **Hardware Requirements**:
    - A standard computer capable of running a virtual machine.
    - At least 4GB of RAM and 20GB of free disk space for the VM.
    - **Note**: A special wireless adapter is **not** needed for this part of the tutorial, as we are working with a sample file.
- **Software Requirements**:
    - **Virtualization Software**: VirtualBox (recommended) or VMware Workstation Player.
    - **Operating System**: A current Kali Linux VM image.
- **Tool Installation**:
    - Run the following commands in the Kali terminal to ensure all tools are installed and up-to-date:
    ```bash
    sudo apt update && sudo apt upgrade -y
    sudo apt install -y aircrack-ng wireshark tshark hcxtools hashcat
    ```
- **Tool Breakdown**:
    - `aircrack-ng`: A suite of tools for auditing wireless networks. We will use it for a simple cracking workflow.
    - `wireshark`: A graphical network protocol analyzer used to inspect the captured handshake.
    - `tshark`: The command-line version of Wireshark, useful for scripting and automation.
    - `hcxtools`: A powerful set of tools to convert and manipulate handshake captures for modern cracking tools.
    - `hashcat`: The world's fastest and most advanced password recovery utility, capable of leveraging GPUs for massive speed improvements.

## 3. Using a Sample Capture

For this phase, we will use a pre-existing capture file named `wpa2_handshake.pcap`.

> **[Placeholder: Link to download `wpa2_handshake.pcap` file]**

- **Step 1: Open the Capture in Wireshark**
    - Launch Wireshark from the Kali menu or by typing `wireshark` in the terminal.
    - Go to `File` > `Open` and select the `wpa2_handshake.pcap` file.
- **Step 2: Filter for Handshake Packets**
    - In the Wireshark display filter bar at the top, type `eapol` and press Enter.
    - This filter isolates the 4-way handshake packets from all other captured traffic.
- **Step 3: Identify the Complete Handshake**
    - Look for a sequence of four EAPOL packets.
    - Wireshark's "Info" column is very helpful here, as it will often label the packets as "Message 1 of 4", "Message 2 of 4", etc.
    - Verify that these four messages are exchanged between the same two devices (the Access Point and a single Client).

## 4. Cracking Workflow

With a valid handshake identified in our capture file, we can proceed to the cracking phase.

### Method A: `aircrack-ng` (CPU-Based, Simple)
This method is straightforward and great for beginners. It uses the CPU and is slower but works directly with `.cap` files.

- **Step 1: Identify the Target Network**
    - Note the BSSID (MAC address) of the Access Point from the Wireshark capture.
- **Step 2: Prepare a Wordlist**
    - A wordlist is a text file containing one potential password per line. Kali comes with some default lists, like `rockyou.txt`.
- **Step 3: Run the Cracking Command**
    ```bash
    aircrack-ng -w /path/to/your/wordlist.txt -b <BSSID> wpa2_handshake.pcap
    ```
    - `-w`: Specifies the path to your wordlist file.
    - `-b`: Specifies the BSSID of the target Access Point.
    - `aircrack-ng` will confirm a handshake is present and begin testing keys.

### Method B: `hcxtools` and `hashcat` (GPU-Based, Advanced)
This is the professional method, offering significantly higher cracking speeds by using a GPU.

- **Step 1: Convert the Capture File**
    - Use `hcxpcapngtool` from the `hcxtools` suite to extract the handshake and convert it into a hash format that `hashcat` understands.
    ```bash
    hcxpcapngtool -o hash.22000 wpa2_handshake.pcap
    ```
    - This command creates a new file, `hash.22000`, containing only the essential data for cracking.
- **Step 2: Run `hashcat`**
    - Execute the `hashcat` command to begin the cracking process.
    ```bash
    hashcat -m 22000 hash.22000 /path/to/your/wordlist.txt
    ```
    - `-m 22000`: This is crucial. It tells `hashcat` the specific hash type we are targeting (WPA2-PSK).
    - The first argument is the converted hash file.
    - The second argument is the wordlist.
    - `hashcat` will start, utilizing the GPU if available, and show progress as it works through the wordlist.

## 5. Ethics and Scope

- **Legal Warning**: Unauthorized access to computer networks is a criminal offense in most jurisdictions. This tutorial is for educational purposes only.
- **Rule of Engagement**:
    - **Only** perform these techniques on networks you personally own.
    - **Only** perform these techniques on networks where you have received explicit, written permission from the owner to conduct security testing.
- **Our Scope**: For this guide, we are strictly working with a pre-recorded capture file to learn the technical process. We are **not** performing any live packet capture or interacting with any networks we do not own.

## 6. WPA3 Notes

WPA3 is the modern security standard that directly addresses the handshake capture vulnerability of WPA2.

- **SAE (Simultaneous Authentication of Equals)**:
    - WPA3 replaces the 4-way handshake with a new method called SAE, also known as the "Dragonfly" handshake.
    - SAE is an interactive key exchange that is resistant to offline dictionary attacks. Even if an attacker captures the entire SAE handshake, they cannot take it offline to guess passwords.
- **WPA2/WPA3 Transition Mode**:
    - Many modern routers operate in a "transition mode" to support both older WPA2 devices and newer WPA3 devices.
    - **Warning**: This mode is still vulnerable. If a WPA2 device connects to a network in transition mode, it will use the classic 4-way handshake, which can be captured and cracked using the methods described in this tutorial.
- **Further Reading**: For a deep dive into the cryptographic details and early implementation flaws, research the **Dragonblood** attack.

## 7. Checklist for Live Capture (Future Tutorial)

This checklist outlines the steps for a future tutorial involving live network capture. **Do not attempt these without a compatible adapter and a fully authorized test network.**

- [ ] Acquire a compatible wireless network adapter (e.g., Alfa AWUS036NHA).
- [ ] Verify the adapter is recognized by Kali Linux (`iwconfig`, `lsusb`).
- [ ] Practice putting the adapter into monitor mode (`sudo airmon-ng start wlan0`).
- [ ] Practice using `airodump-ng` to scan for local networks and identify targets.
- [ ] Develop a clear plan for capturing a handshake from an **authorized** test network.
- [ ] Review and document understanding of local laws and regulations regarding wireless network auditing.
