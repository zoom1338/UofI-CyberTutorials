# Sprint 1 Report (8/26/25 - 9/09/2025)

## What's New (User Facing)
 * Initial repository structure created and README updated.
 * Completed 3 research logs and 1 one-pager on initial findings.
 * Scaffolds for Wireshark and WPA2 tutorials have been started.
 * Wi-Fi lab setup in Dana 117 has been documented.

## Work Summary (Developer Facing)
This sprint focused on foundational setup and initial research. We established the project's repository structure and documentation standards. A significant portion of the sprint was dedicated to research, resulting in three detailed logs and a one-pager summary. We also began scaffolding the initial tutorials for Wireshark and WPA2 cracking and documented the physical lab setup. The next steps will involve building out the Wi-Fi cracking tutorials and beginning experiments in Mobile AppSec.

## Unfinished Work
Final polish and the creation of a demo video are pending.
