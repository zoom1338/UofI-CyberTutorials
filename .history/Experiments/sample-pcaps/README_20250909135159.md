# Sample Packet Captures

This directory is for storing sample `.pcap` or `.pcapng` files for testing and demonstration purposes.

## Saving Captures

When adding new capture files, please use descriptive names that indicate the type of traffic captured. For example, `wpa2_handshake.pcapng` or `http_get_request.pcap`.

## Capturing EAPOL Packets

Here are some sample commands for capturing EAPOL (Extensible Authentication Protocol over LAN) packets, which are part of the WPA/WPA2 handshake.

### airodump-ng

`airodump-ng` is part of the aircrack-ng suite and is used for capturing 802.11 frames.

**Command:**

```bash
# Replace wlan0mon with your wireless interface in monitor mode
# Replace --bssid XX:XX:XX:XX:XX:XX with the BSSID of the target AP
# Replace -c X with the channel of the target AP
# Replace -w capture_file with the desired output file name
airodump-ng --bssid XX:XX:XX:XX:XX:XX -c X -w capture_file wlan0mon
```

This command will save the capture to `capture_file-01.cap`. You can then filter for EAPOL packets in Wireshark.

### tcpdump

`tcpdump` is a powerful command-line packet analyzer.

**Command:**

```bash
# Replace wlan0 with your wireless interface
# Use 'ether proto 0x888e' to filter for EAPOL packets
# Replace -w capture_file.pcap with the desired output file name
sudo tcpdump -i wlan0 -w capture_file.pcap 'ether proto 0x888e'
```

This command captures only the EAPOL packets and saves them to `capture_file.pcap`.
