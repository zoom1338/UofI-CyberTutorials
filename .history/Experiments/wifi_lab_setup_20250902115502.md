# Wi-Fi Lab Setup for Packet Analysis

This document outlines the hardware and software for setting up a Wi-Fi packet capture lab using Kali Linux.

## Hardware Shortlist

A USB Wi-Fi adapter that supports both monitor mode and packet injection is required. Here are some recommended chipsets and models:

*   **Atheros AR9271:**
    *   TP-Link TL-WN722N (Version 1 only)
    *   Alfa AWUS036NHA
*   **Ralink RT3070:**
    *   Alfa AWUS036NH
*   **Realtek RTL8812AU:**
    *   Alfa AWUS036ACH
    *   TP-Link Archer T4U V3

*Note: Always verify the adapter version and chipset before purchasing, as manufacturers can change them without notice.*

## Live-Capture Commands

The following commands will be used for capturing and analyzing Wi-Fi traffic.

### 1. Enable Monitor Mode

First, identify your wireless interface (`wlan0`, `wlan1`, etc.) and put it into monitor mode.

```bash
# Check for wireless interfaces
iwconfig

# Start monitor mode on the target interface (e.g., wlan0)
sudo airmon-ng start wlan0
```
This will create a new monitor interface, usually named `wlan0mon`.

### 2. Capture Packets

Use `airodump-ng` to scan for networks and capture packets from a specific target.

```bash
# Scan for all nearby Wi-Fi networks
sudo airodump-ng wlan0mon

# Capture packets from a specific BSSID and channel, saving to a file
sudo airodump-ng --bssid [Target BSSID] -c [Channel] -w [CaptureFile] wlan0mon
```

### 3. Deauthentication Attack (For WPA Handshake Capture)

To capture a WPA/WPA2 handshake, you can force a client to disconnect and reconnect using a deauthentication attack.

```bash
# Send deauth packets to a specific client
sudo aireplay-ng -0 5 -a [Target BSSID] -c [Client MAC] wlan0mon
```
**Warning:** Only perform this on networks you own or have explicit permission to test.

### 4. Export to CSV

The captured data can be exported to CSV for easier analysis. `airodump-ng` automatically creates a `.csv` file when using the `-w` flag.

## CSV Fields Explanation

The generated CSV file from `airodump-ng` contains the following key fields:

*   **BSSID:** The MAC address of the Access Point.
*   **First time seen:** The timestamp when the network was first detected.
*   **Last time seen:** The timestamp when the network was last detected.
*   **channel:** The channel the network is operating on.
*   **Speed:** The maximum supported speed of the network.
*   **Privacy:** The encryption method used (e.g., WPA2, WEP).
*   **Cipher:** The specific cipher used for encryption.
*   **Authentication:** The authentication method.
*   **Power:** The signal strength.
*   **# beacons:** The number of beacon frames received.
*   **# IV:** The number of initialization vectors received.
*   **LAN IP:** The IP address of the network.
*   **ID-length:** The length of the ESSID.
*   **ESSID:** The public name of the Wi-Fi network.
*   **Key:** The captured WPA key (if successful).
