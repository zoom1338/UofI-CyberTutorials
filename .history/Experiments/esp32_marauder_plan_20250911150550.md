# ESP32 Marauder Handshake Capture Plan

## Goal
The primary goal of this experiment is to capture WPA2 handshakes using an ESP32 Marauder device. The captured handshakes will then be processed with `hcxtools` and cracked using `hashcat`.

## Parts List
- ESP32 board (specific model to be confirmed)
- 2x Mini breadboards
- Jumper wires
- Touchscreen display (optional, for easier interaction)
- Female socket pins (if available, for soldering)

## Risks & Ethics
- **Authorization**: All testing will be conducted on authorized networks and access points only.
- **Scope**: No campus-wide or unauthorized network scans will be performed.
- **Downtime**: Measures will be taken to avoid causing downtime for any clients on the test network. All deauthentication attacks will be targeted and brief.

## TODOs
- [ ] Pick up parts from the lab
- [ ] Assemble the ESP32 Marauder hardware
- [ ] Flash the latest Marauder firmware
- [ ] Test handshake capture against the lab's designated AP
- [ ] Document all steps with photos for the final report
