## 1. Executive Summary

This document outlines the progress made on the ESP32 Marauder WPA2 penetration testing project. As of November 18th, 2025, the initial data acquisition phases (0-5) are complete. The necessary WPA2 handshake data has been successfully captured from the target network (`Cybersecurity-Capstone_2.4GHz`).

The project is now moving into the data processing and password cracking phases (6-9). The current timeline aligns with the goal of completing all primary objectives by the end of November, in preparation for the poster submission on December 1st and the final presentation on December 4th.

## 2. Completed Milestones (Phases 0-5)

The foundational work of setting up the environment and capturing the target data is complete.

-   **[x] Phase 0 – Goal & Asset Definition:** Confirmed project objectives and verified all required hardware (ESP32 Marauder, configured router) is operational.
-   **[x] Phase 1 – Router Configuration:** The target access point, `Cybersecurity-Capstone_2.4GHz`, was configured and locked with WPA2-Personal security.
-   **[x] Phase 2 – Marauder Settings Verification:** Key Marauder settings (`ForcePMKID`, `ForceProbe`, `SavePCAP`, `EPDeauth`) were enabled to ensure successful capture.
-   **[x] Phase 3 – Target AP Scan:** The Marauder successfully identified the target network, noting its BSSID and channel.
-   **[x] Phase 4 – Handshake/PMKID Capture:** An active EAP/PMKID sniff was executed, forcing client de-authentication and successfully capturing the required handshake data.
-   **[x] Phase 5 – Capture Verification:** The resulting `EAP_0.pcap` file was transferred from the Marauder's SD card to a laptop and verified to be present and non-empty, confirming a successful capture.

## 3. Immediate Next Steps (Phases 6-9)

The focus now shifts to cracking the captured handshake and verifying the result.

-   **[ ] Phase 6 – Convert PCAP to Hashcat Format:**
    -   Upload `EAP_0.pcap` to an online converter to generate a `.hc22000` hash file.
    -   Organize the hash file within the local Hashcat directory.
-   **[ ] Phase 7 – Build Custom Wordlist:**
    -   Create a small, targeted wordlist (`capstone.txt`) containing potential passwords for the dictionary attack.
-   **[ ] Phase 8 – Run Hashcat:**
    -   Execute Hashcat using mode `-m 22000` to perform a dictionary attack on the captured hash.
    -   Document the command used and the successful recovery of the password.
-   **[ ] Phase 9 – Verify Access with Recovered Password:**
    -   Use the cracked password to connect a device to the `Cybersecurity-Capstone_2.4GHz` network.
    -   Confirm successful authentication and network access to validate the entire process.

## 4. Project Timeline & Deliverables

The project is proceeding on a strict timeline to meet final submission deadlines.

-   **Key Deadline 1:** Poster Submission (December 1st)
-   **Key Deadline 2:** Final Presentation (December 4th)

To meet these deadlines, the goal is to have all technical phases and initial tutorial drafts completed by the end of November.

## 5. Tutorial Development Plan

In parallel with the final technical phases, work will proceed on the tutorial deliverables. The planned structure for the video tutorial is as follows:

1.  **Introduction:** Project overview, goals, and a discussion of challenges encountered (e.g., hardware assembly, troubleshooting).
2.  **Part 1: Building the ESP32 Marauder:** A comprehensive guide covering hardware assembly, soldering, flashing the firmware, and installing necessary software like Putty.
3.  **Part 2: Penetration Testing in Action:** A step-by-step walkthrough of the entire Wi-Fi cracking process, from scanning to the final password recovery (Phases 1-9).
4.  **Conclusion:** A summary of the results and a discussion of potential future work or improvements.
