Weekly Meetings with the instructor/mentor to discuss the previous week's progress and set goals for the current week, task progress, and non-immediate roadblocks. These meetings are designed to touch base. The project mentor also serves in the role of sponsor, clarifying project deliverables and maintaining a close connection to the project and previous contributions.
Weekly Team-only meetings to discuss more administrative, non-technical project tasks. These meetings provide an open space for communication about the mentor meeting and to update the project board, individual sprint deliverables, and allocate work amongst team members. The open forum of discussion also addressed non-immediate questions and communication between the team and mentor.
The team utilized GitHub, Discord, Zoom, and email for communication and project organization. The team's project GitHub repository also includes a GitHub Project where the team creates issues in the repository and tracks them on GitHub. This allowed team members to see what each other were working on without pulling up the commit log or interfering with each other's branches.
