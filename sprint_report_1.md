# Sprint 1 Report (8/18/25 - 9/13/2025)

## What's New (User Facing)
* Repo structure + README “Repo Map”
* Research logs (2025-08-30, 08-31, 09-01)
* Wireshark Intro doc + 12 screenshots embedded
* WPA2 tutorial scaffold (lab setup, sample capture, cracking paths)
* Wi-Fi lab setup notes (Dana 117 router)

## Work Summary (Developer Facing)
* Set up Git branch WPA_2/3-v2; added notes, scaffolds, and experiments.
* Coordinated with CSG for a dedicated AP; documented safe-testing cautions.
* Built repeatable note workflow (daily logs) and experiment folders.
* Aligned deliverables and schedule between teamates.

## Unfinished Work
* Initial live WPA2 handshake capture pending (hardware pickup tomorrow).
* Wordlist approval pending (small, ethical test lists).
* Mobile AppSec Static analysis experiment draft (Isabella) in progress.


## Completed Issues/User Stories
All issues are still in progress.
 
 ## Incomplete Issues/User Stories
 Here are links to issues we worked on but did not complete in this sprint:
 
* https://github.com/zoom1338/UofI-CyberTutorials/issues/5  - setup for testing Dynamic security analysis, andriod emulator doesn't work on VMs.
* WPA2 live capture: waiting on NIC/ESP32; will execute in Sprint 2.
* ESP32 Marauder build: parts pickup + assembly scheduled.
