# Sprint 2 Report

## What's New
* Assembled ESP32 Marauder breadboard setup.
* Installed required USB drivers and Python dependencies.
* Successfully flashed firmware (confirmed boot).
* Created full assembly and wiring tutorial documentation.
* Prepared visual progress update for client (AJ).

## Work Summary
This sprint focused on hardware assembly and firmware configuration. We sourced and received all hardware, soldered missing pins, verified TFT power, and debugged USB-to-UART driver detection issues. After successful firmware flashing, we documented the build process and progress with detailed photos and markdown guides.

## Unfinished Work
* SD card logging integration (pending after stable display test).
* Portable battery power source integration.

## Completed Issues/User Stories
* Hardware setup and verification ✅
* Firmware flashing and testing ✅
* Documentation and progress reporting ✅

## Incomplete Issues/User Stories
* Battery integration (requires voltage testing).
* SD card read/write validation.

## Code Files for Review
* Drafts/ESP32_Marauder_Assembly_Tutorial.md
* deliverables/marauder_progress_update_for_AJ.md

## Retrospective Summary
Here's what went well:
* Solid collaboration and communication.
* Successful hardware assembly and flashing.
* Early troubleshooting of driver and wiring issues.

Here's what we'd like to improve:
* Time management during heavy academic and cheer weeks.
* Improve version tracking between documentation files.

Here are changes we plan to implement in the next sprint:
* Integrate battery and test power independence.
* Validate SD card logging and Wi-Fi handshake capture.
* Begin KRACK attack simulation testing.
