# Sprint 1 Report 

## What's New (User Facing)
- Repo structure + README “Repo Map”
- Research logs (2025-08-30, 08-31, 09-01)
- Wireshark Intro doc + 12 screenshots embedded
- WPA2 tutorial scaffold (lab setup, sample capture, cracking paths)
- Wi-Fi lab setup notes (Dana 117 router)

## Work Summary (Developer Facing)
- Set up Git branch WPA_2/3-v2; added notes, scaffolds, and experiments.
- Coordinated with CSG for a dedicated AP; documented safe-testing cautions.
- Built repeatable note workflow (daily logs) and experiment folders.
- Aligned with partner (Mobile AppSec track) on deliverables and schedule.

## Unfinished Work
- Initial live WPA2 handshake capture pending (hardware pickup tomorrow).
- Wordlist approval pending (small, ethical test lists).
- Mobile AppSec first experiment draft (Isabella) in progress.

## Completed Issues/User Stories

## Code Files for Review
- Drafts/wpa2_tutorial.md
- Experiments/wireshark_intro.md
- Experiments/wifi_lab_setup.md

## Retrospective Summary
- Went well: quick lab access; clear repo cadence; solid written scaffolds.
