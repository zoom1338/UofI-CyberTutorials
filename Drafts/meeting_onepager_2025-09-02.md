# Meeting Onepager: 2025-09-02

## Progress So Far
- Repository structure established and organized.
- `.gitignore` and `README.md` files are up-to-date.
- Three research logs completed, detailing initial findings.
- Scaffolding for the WPA2 tutorial has been initiated.

## Blockers & Needs
- **Hardware:** Awaiting delivery of a compatible USB Wi-Fi adapter.
- **Access:** Need confirmed access to the lab environment.
- **Approval:** Pending approval for the selected wordlist for cracking exercises.

## Plan for Next 7 Days
- Finalize the detailed outline for the WPA2 tutorial.
- Complete the physical and software setup of the Wi-Fi lab.
- Capture initial test `.pcap` files for analysis.
- Draft the introduction and background sections of the tutorial.
- Follow up on wordlist approval.

## Risks & Mitigations
- **Risk:** Delays in receiving hardware or lab access.
  - **Mitigation:** Proceed with writing non-practical sections of the tutorial that don't require lab work.
- **Risk:** The chosen wordlist is not approved.
  - **Mitigation:** Use a smaller, commonly available wordlist for initial development and testing.
