Here’s the info for the CYSEC wifi to pass along to your students.  They need to be down by EME 136 or by the cybersecurity club room in Dana to see the network.

\*\* One MUST restart their machine after installing this on a Windows machine otherwise the service won’t start.





info to enter into the vpn client:

address: cyber.vpn.wsu.edu

username: cyber.student

password: !!WSUCyber123!!

&nbsp;



Please note that the vpn only routes traffic to 10.175.0.0/16 (the overall cysec group of networks) so visiting something like https://ifconfig.me will not show you having a different address.



You should be able to use the cysec vpn to reach the EME 136 cysec desktops.
