# Sprint 4 Action Plan

**Sprint Dates:** 2025-11-09 to 2025-11-29

## Sprint Goal
The primary goal of Sprint 4 is to transition from hardware setup and troubleshooting to content creation and final project deliverables. This includes finalizing the WPA2 tutorial, creating the Wi-Fi cracking lab manual, and preparing the final project report.

## Action Items

### 1. Solder ESP32 Marauder Connections
*   **Task:** Solder the connections on the ESP32 Marauder to permanently fix the SD card issue.
*   **Details:** This is the highest priority task for Sprint 4, as it is the final step in resolving the hardware issues and unblocking the rest of the project.
*   **Priority:** Critical
*   **Status:** Not Started

### 2. Finalize ESP32 Marauder Setup
*   **Task:** Complete the final setup and configuration of the ESP32 Marauder.
*   **Details:** This includes ensuring the device is fully functional, portable, and ready for use in the tutorials. All necessary firmware should be installed and tested.
*   **Priority:** High
*   **Status:** In Progress

### 2. Develop WPA2 Tutorial
*   **Task:** Complete the WPA2 tutorial, including creating the necessary documentation and code samples.
*   **Details:** The current draft of the WPA2 tutorial is a good starting point, but it needs to be expanded with more detailed explanations, screenshots, and a sample `wpa2_handshake.pcap` file. The tutorial should be easy to follow for someone with a basic understanding of cybersecurity concepts.
*   **Priority:** High
*   **Status:** In Progress

### 3. Create WiFi Cracking Lab Manual
*   **Task:** Create the WiFi cracking lab manual, which will provide detailed instructions for setting up and using the lab environment.
*   **Details:** The current draft of the lab manual is a good overview, but it needs to be expanded with more detailed instructions, screenshots, and safety warnings. The manual should be comprehensive enough for someone to set up the lab and perform the exercises without assistance.
*   **Priority:** High
*   **Status:** In Progress

### 4. Prepare for Final Report
*   **Task:** Begin outlining and drafting the final project report to ensure it is completed on time.
*   **Details:** The final report should include a detailed overview of the project, the work that was completed, the challenges that were overcome, and the final results. The report should be well-organized and easy to read.
*   **Priority:** Medium
*   **Status:** Not Started

## Sprint 4 Timeline

*   **Week 1 (2025-11-09 to 2025-11-15):**
    *   Finalize ESP32 Marauder setup.
    *   Complete the WPA2 tutorial.
*   **Week 2 (2025-11-16 to 2025-11-22):**
    *   Complete the WiFi cracking lab manual.
    *   Begin outlining the final project report.
*   **Week 3 (2025-11-23 to 2025-11-29):**
    *   Draft the final project report.
    *   Review and revise all project deliverables.

## Next Steps
The immediate next step is to complete the final setup of the ESP32 Marauder. Once the hardware is fully functional, the focus will shift to completing the WPA2 tutorial and the WiFi cracking lab manual. The final project report will be drafted in the last week of the sprint.
